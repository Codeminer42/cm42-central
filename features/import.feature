  Background:
    Given today is "2024-05-10"
    And the following users exist:
      | email                | name             | initials | username | admin |
      | micah@botandrose.com | Micah Geisel     | MG       | micahg   | Yes   | 
      | gubs@botandrose.com  | Michael Gubitosa | GUBS     | gubs     | Yes   | 

  Scenario: Admin imports a project from Pivotal Tracker
    Given I am logged in as "micah@botandrose.com"
    When I follow "Refresh"
    Then I should see the following importable projects:
